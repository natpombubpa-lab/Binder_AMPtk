### below workaround from @fomightez: https://github.com/fomightez/modelit-binder/blob/master/binder/postBuild
# Upon addition of Jupytext, I was seeing it want to build when session launched. Seems
# explained at https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#jupytext-commands-in-jupyterlab
# >"The Jupytext extension for JupyterLab is bundled with Jupytext. Installing Jupytext will trigger a build of JupyterLab the next time you open it. If you prefer, you can trigger the build manually with `jupyter lab build`"
# Running that here to avoid it showing pop-up at launch.
jupyter lab build
